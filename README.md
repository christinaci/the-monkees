#Christina Clarke's project
**Milestone project 1: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute**
This is a website I created for a band so that fans and potential new fans could easily find the band's most loved old songs, along with any new music they have just released. It was also created so fans can see and purchase tickets to any upcoming shows. It also contains contact email and contact form so website users can contact the band for any bookings.
