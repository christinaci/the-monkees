# Christina Clarke's project
**Milestone project 1: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute**
- This is a website I created for a band so that fans and potential new fans could easily find the Monkees' most loved old songs, along with any new music released recently. It was also created so fans can see and purchase tickets to any upcoming shows and a contact form so website users can contact the band for any bookings.

## Demo
- A live demo can be found here: https://christinaci.github.io/the-monkees/

## UX
- With the brief in mind, the aim of the website was to create a simple, easy to use website for users to quickly find information the clients wanted them to have. The same colour scheme and navbar are consistent throughout each page so information is easy to find as you go through the sections. Social links are also available on each page. The home page contains the Monkee's most loved songs for fans to instantly listen and be reunited with their most famous songs. For new fans there is some information about the band highlighting their 50 years and success in the music industry. Videos are at the centre of both the "About" and "New Music" page so new curious fans can instantly listen to their music old and new. A "contact" page was created to highlight the possibility of contacting the band for bookings which was noted in the brief. 

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap (4.1.0)

## Features
- This site contains ticketmaster link underneath the dates of upcoming shows to bring fans directly to the purchase link.
- This site also uses a contact form on the contacts page to make booking more efficient.

## Features left to implement 
- I would like add some animations or motion graphics to the index page to add a little bit more life when you first click into the page.
- Another feature I would like to add in the future would be an interactive calendar of the Monkee's upcoming shows and also for booking the band.

## Testing
- In the About page users can read some information on the band and play youtube videos of their most famous song. Maunually tested when the screen is minimised that each element adjusts it's size and the videos stack on top of one another. This was tested on Google chrome, Safari and Mozilla firefox along with ios mobile device. 

- In the upcoming shows page, a button underneath upcoming show dates link to ticketmaster where fans could purchase tickets was manually tested.
- In the contact us page, a contact form asks for an email address, region and date of event to be submitted. When all fields were blank a warning message appears and the submit button cannot be pressed. When just one field was left blank the same warning message would appear on the field left blank and the submit button cannot be actioned. 
- A bug I failed to address however is when all fields are filled out and the submit button is actioned it brings the user to a "not found" URL.

## Deployment
The live site is deployed on GitHub pages. It uses the master branch. It updates each time there is a new push to the repository.
